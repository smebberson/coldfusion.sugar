## About

The ColdFusion.sugar is maintained here and is the best place to watch development and get the latest versions of the Sugar.
I'm always looking for suggestions and ideas for improving the sugar. Please send through any suggestions or improvements <scott@scottmebberson.com>

## Features
* Syntax Highlighting (thanks Jonathan!)
* Basic code hinting for _all_ tags (ColdFusion 8)
* Tag attribute hinting for _some_ tags
* Code-folding (still buggy)

## To Come
This Sugar is only VERY new. I'll be working on the following features in the days to come.

* More attribute support
* ColdFusion functions code hinting

I hope you enjoy it!
